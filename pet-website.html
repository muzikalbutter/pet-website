    <h2>Hungry Hippo</h2>
    <h3>December 19, 2018</h3>

    <p>I hate Hammy. She's such a hungry hippo. All she cares about is food. And when she's not eating, she's pissing off me and Cheeto.</p>
    <p>Some things I can tolerate more than Hammy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fleas</li>
      <li>That fancy wet food that makes me want to cover it with litter rather than eat it</li>
      <li>Having my toes cleaned</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If it's not obvious, I hate Hammy.</p>
